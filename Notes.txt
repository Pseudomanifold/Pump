--describe-yourself:

YAML:

  Input files (ordered)
  Output files (ordered)

An edge in the flow plan can be processed as soon as the corresponding
node finished running. If its execution finished successfully, each of
its outputs is ready for further operations.

Hence, to process an edge I merely need to check whether its input is
finished.

Is is possible to connect an input port to an output port? No, of course
not. The data flow can only move in one direction and that direction is
specified by the semantics of the ports. Consequently, 'in' and 'out'
may be dropped from the port specification...

This has implications for the edge processing interface.

---

Harness: Permit using `pump` with arbitrary programs. Provides an
interface by specifying the number of command-line parameters.

---

Problem: If an input filename is not unique, data cannot flow properly
or incorrect data may be used. `pump` should aim for ordering edges as
in a BFS traversal. In this case, only the output files of the targets
must not coincide.
